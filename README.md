# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns based on Launch Date and Goal.

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the best information possible to inform the goal amount and launch date of a Theater Kickstarter campaign.

### Analysis and Challenges
The analysis provided clear indications of how to launch a successful Kistarter campaign.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Launch Date](C:\Users\clava\DAP\Crowdfunding Data Analysis\Resources\Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch)
The most number of successful campaigns occured in May, June, and July.  However, those were also the months with the most overall campaigns.  As a percentage, May (67%) was the most successful month, followed by June(65%), while July(63%) tied with April(63%) and February(63%).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
![Goals](C:\Users\clava\DAP\Crowdfunding Data Analysis\Resources\Outcomes_vs_Goals)
There was a negative correlation between goal amounts and the percentage of campaigns that were successful from the Less than $1,000 range until the $25,499-$29,4999 range.  At that point the success rate increases, however, there were only 11 projects with a goal above the $29,4999 level.  76% of campaigns had a goal of less than $5,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge with this analysis is that it only looks at raw data, there is no qualitative analyis or further categorization of the type of Theater campaign was launched.

## Results
A campaign of less than $5,000 that launches in May or June has a higher probability of success. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
*  Campaigns launched in Late Spring/Early Summer have the highest success rate.
*  Do not launch a campaign in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 If possible, set your goal at or below $5,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Analysis of reasons for failure other than Launch Date and Goal Amount.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table and graph specifically related to plays in the US.
